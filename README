Autotest Shell - monitor a folder for changes, and call a validation/test routine for any changed files
Repo Shell - syntax checks and test-case running by file name
Notify Vendor - send status messages

To use as a pre-commit hook, create/edit .git/hooks/pre-commit with the following contents:
>>>
cake repo checkFiles pre-commit
<<<

Make the file executable and the repo shell will then be called each time you commit.

To use automatically whenever you edit a file in your project, run "cake autotest" from the folder
you want to be monitored. Using with screen may be convenient ("screen cake autotest") as you can
then close the terminal and the process will continue to run.
