Installation
===========

To be able to use this package anywhere on your computer, move the files to the following location:
...
	app
	someotherapp
	cake
	vendors
		notify.php
		shells
			autotest.php
			repo.php

Notify - send status messages
Autotest - monitor a folder for changes, and call the repo shell for any changed files
Repo - syntax checks and test-case running by file name

Using as a git hook
==================
To use as a pre-commit hook, create/edit .git/hooks/pre-commit with the following contents:
>>>
cake repo checkFiles pre-commit
<<<

Make the file executable and the repo shell will then be called each time you commit.

Using realtime
==============
To use automatically whenever you edit a file in your project, run "cake autotest" from the folder
you want to be monitored. Using with screen may be convenient ("screen cake autotest") as you can
then close the terminal and the process will continue to run.
